        Correlations are never lower than -1. A correlation of -1 indicates that the data points in a scatter plot lie exactly on a straight descending line; the two variables are perfectly negatively linearly related.
        A correlation of 0 means that two variables don't have any linear relation whatsoever. However, some non linear relation may exist between the two variables.
